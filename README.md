# hello-world
just for learn how to use github
i am sitting here in a broing room, it just another rainy sunday afternoon. 
i'm waisting my time, i got nothing to do.
i'm hanging around and i'm waiting for you.
but nothing ever happens,and i wonder
i wonder how,i wonder why.
yesterday you told me about the bule,bule sky
and all that i can see is just a yellow lemon tree
